# Refactoring Plan

## Information Gathered:
- The current schema includes models for User, Post, Comment, and Reaction, with their respective fields and relationships.
- Controllers and routes need to be updated to ensure they align with the current schema and utilize middleware for validation.

## Specific Changes Needed:

### UserController
- Ensure that the role is validated against the schema.
- Update any user-related functions to reflect changes in the User model if necessary.

### AuthController
- Validate user input against the UserSchema.
- Ensure that the registration and login processes align with the current schema.

### MessageController
- Validate message content against the MessageSchema.
- Ensure that message creation and retrieval align with the current schema.

### ChatRoomController
- Validate chat room data against the ChatRoomSchema.
- Ensure that chat room creation and updates align with the current schema.

### UserChatRoomController
- Ensure that user-chat room associations are created and deleted according to the current schema.

### Routes
- Update routes to ensure they are correctly mapped to the refactored controller functions.
- Ensure that middleware validations are applied where necessary.

## Middleware Considerations:
- Ensure that all middleware validations are in place for user input and authorization checks.

## Follow-Up Steps:
- Implement the changes in the respective controllers and routes.
- Test the application to ensure that all functionalities work as expected after the refactor.
